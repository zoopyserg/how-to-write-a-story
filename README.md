## A short version of "A Practical Guide to THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES by Joseph Campbell
## Based on "The Hero with a Thousand Faces" and "The Writer's Journey - 3rd Edition: Mythic Structure for Writers Library Binding".

### Main heros of the story:
- The young hero
- The wise old man
- The shape shifting woman
- The shadowy nemesis

### Universal questions:
- Why was I born?
- What happens when I die?
- How can I overcome my life problems and be happy?

### The stages of the HERO:
1. The hero is introduced in his ordinary world.
(show what's normal for him before you show how heroic he is in abnormal situation).
2. The call to adventure.
(Problem/challenge/adventure/first sight/calling/etc.)
3. The hero is reluctant at first.
(because he faces the fear of unknown; but then smth happens and he realizes being reluctant is not ok).
4. The hero is encouraged by the wise old man/woman.
(hero's mentor gives advice, motivation, and magical weapons; the mentor can only go so far, eventually the hero must face the unknown by himself)
5. The hero passes the first threshold.
(makes his first steps into his journey).
6. The hero encounters tests and helpers.
- makes friends and allies in the special world
- pass certain tests and challenges
7. The hero reaches the innermost cave
(the hero comes to a dangerous place, often underground, where the object of his quest is hidden - it could be headquater of his nemesis, or hero's own dream world)
8. The hero endures the supreme ordeal.
The hero touches the bottom. Faces possibility of death from a mythical beast. This is a critical moment of the story where hero appears to die and gets born again. This is a thrilling moment, like in an amusement park.
9. The hero seizes the sword.
Having survived death, beaten the dragon, slain the monster - the hero now takes possession of the treasure he's come seeking (special weapon, magic item, knowledge and experience, settling a conflict, reconciled with a woman, rescue marriage, etc.
10. The road back.
He's not out of the woods yet. He starts getting chased by forces from which he's stolen the treasure.
11. Resurrection.
The hero comes back from special world, transformed by his experience. Replaying the near-death part of the story.
12. Hero comes back to ordinary world with his treasure.
If he didn't bring the treasure he's doomed to do the story again.
(comedies usually here make the stupid hero lose his treasure)
